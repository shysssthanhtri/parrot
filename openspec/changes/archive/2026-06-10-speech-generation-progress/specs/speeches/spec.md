## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Speech detail API

The system SHALL expose a tRPC `speeches.getById` query that returns a single speech by `id` with voice and script relations (including script `content`), `processStatus`, optional `errorMessage`, `totalChunks`, `settledChunks`, stored `alignment` when present, and a resolved audio preview URL from storage only when `processStatus` is `finished` and the final object exists, or reports not found.

#### Scenario: Unknown speech id

- **WHEN** `speeches.getById` is called with a non-existent id
- **THEN** the procedure returns a not-found error

#### Scenario: Detail includes audio URL when finished

- **WHEN** `speeches.getById` is called for a speech with `processStatus` `finished` and a final WAV at `r2ObjectKey`
- **THEN** the response includes a playable audio URL resolved via the configured storage driver

#### Scenario: Detail omits audio URL while processing

- **WHEN** `speeches.getById` is called for a speech with `processStatus` `pending` or `processing`
- **THEN** the response includes `processStatus`, `totalChunks`, and `settledChunks`, and does not include a playable audio URL

#### Scenario: Detail includes alignment and script content

- **WHEN** `speeches.getById` is called for a finished speech with stored alignment
- **THEN** the response includes `alignment` and the linked script's full `content` for synchronized display

#### Scenario: Detail includes chunk counters while processing

- **WHEN** `speeches.getById` is called for a speech with `processStatus` `processing` and `totalChunks` greater than zero
- **THEN** the response includes current `settledChunks` and `totalChunks` values suitable for computing generation progress in the CMS
